## üö® The Problem We Solve

Traditional sign language learning methods often face several challenges:

1. **Lack of Engagement**: Traditional methods fail to capture and retain children's attention
2. **No Real-Time Feedback**: Students don't receive immediate corrections on their gestures
3. **Limited Accessibility**: Quality sign language education is often expensive or unavailable
4. **One-Size-Fits-All**: Content doesn't adapt to different age groups and skill levels
5. **Isolated Learning**: No family involvement or community support

LearnSign addresses all these challenges through innovative technology and thoughtful design.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16.0.0 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** (v4.0 or higher) - [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher) - For AI features - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learnsign.git
cd learnsign
```

### Step 2: Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
API_PORT=4000

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/learnsign
# OR use MongoDB Atlas:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/learnsign

# Python API URLs (AI Services)
PYTHON_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
TRANSLATE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
NUMBERS_LETTERS_API_URL=http://localhost:8002

# Session Configuration
SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_change_in_production

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 4: Set Up MongoDB

**Option A: Local MongoDB**
```bash
# Start MongoDB service
sudo systemctl start mongod  # Linux
brew services start mongodb-community  # macOS
# Windows: Run MongoDB as a service from Services
```

**Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)**
1. Create a free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get your connection string
4. Update `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`

### Step 5: Seed the Database

```bash
npm run seed
```

This will populate your database with:
- Sample courses and video tutorials
- Learning packages
- Course categories
- Demo user data

### Step 6: Set Up Python AI Services (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to Python services directory
cd python-services

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Python services (in separate terminals)
python quiz_api.py  # Port 8000
python translate_api.py  # Port 8001
python recognition_api.py  # Port 8002
```

### Step 7: Start the Application

**Development Mode (with auto-reload):**
```bash
# Run both frontend and API servers concurrently
npm run dev:full
```

**Or run servers separately:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: API server
npm run api:dev
```

**Production Mode:**
```bash
# Start frontend server
npm start

# Start API server (in another terminal)
npm run api
```

### Step 8: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:4000
